            <p> In bodybuilding, no one is ever going to hand you a routine that will magically turn you into a physique competitor overnight. It takes years of hard work—and lots of trial and error—to achieve your dream physique. We can make recommendations about the best exercises, successful sets-and-reps schemes, and our favorite training techniques, but at the end of the day you're the judge and jury about whether something works for your body.

            <p>  Presented below are three common training splits, starting with the easiest and progressing to the most advanced. Make no mistake: There are many other options, but these are a great place to start. While beginners should start with the first option, other lifters should consider the four factors listed above when choosing which split to follow.

            <h2>Factors to Consider When Choosing a Training Split</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Training Experience</strong>
                    <p>
                        Beginners require less volume and intensity in their training programs—but often greater frequency—than advanced lifters.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Goals</strong>
                    <p>
                        Are you trying to establish a baseline of fitness, maintain your shape, or pursue larger-scale physique changes?
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Availability</strong>
                    <p>
                        Can you commit to working out five days per week, or is your schedule so tight you can't afford to make gym time on more than a few days? Whichever it is, realize that each bodybuilding workout builds upon the previous one, so you need to be willing to hit the gym at least three days per week.
                    </p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Your Rest and Recovery Needs</strong>
                    <p>
                        Depending on your job, lifestyle, and recovery abilities (including sleep), you may need more or fewer rest days. Rest days shouldn't be trivialized in your pursuit for more muscle. Growth takes place away from the gym, in the presence of good nutrition and adequate rest. In terms of recovery, you don't want to train a muscle group that's still ludicrously sore from a previous workout.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        "You need to learn to listen to your body," says New Orleans IFBB bikini pro Barbara Bolotte, 2011 Optimum Classic winner and BPI Sports athlete. "For me, if I have really sore legs, I'll work arms instead."
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Recovery can also include mental recharging: If you're feeling burned out from too much time in the gym, including more rest days can really help.

                <h3 class="accordion-header"> Whole-Body Split</h3>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p> Training every major muscle group in a single workout is usually the domain of beginners, most often characterized by a single exercise per body part for just a few sets. One of the primary reasons the volume is kept intentionally low per muscle group is that the primary adaptations made by beginners come via the nervous system. You teach your body to activate and utilize more muscle fibers, rather than realizing physical gains in fiber size and strength. This requires greater frequency, and since the volume of work is so low, this workout should ideally be repeated three times per week, with 48 hours between workouts. Be forewarned, though, that you don't want to let a week go by in between workouts like this. If you wait too long, you won't build upon your previous workouts, which can place you back at square one. Another reason volume and intensity are kept low for the newbie is to minimize next-day muscle soreness. "Muscle soreness can be very discouraging for a beginner," says Bolotte. "When I was personal training, I always started clients that were new to the gym on total-body workout routines. Not only did it help them become familiar with all the equipment, but it also allowed them to exercise every body part in moderation instead of just burning out one particular muscle. If you do all legs in a training session, a beginner may feel severe soreness in that muscle group for up to a week, which may discourage that person from coming back."

                <h3 class="accordion-header">Upper- And Lower-Body Split</h3>
                <div class="accordion-content">
                    <p> The volume of work (number of sets and reps) done on each body part is low when following a whole-body split; the next step up is a split in which you cover the entire body over two days, and perform two exercises per muscle group. This is typically done by separating the body into upper-body muscle groups (chest, back, shoulders, arms) and lower-body muscle groups (quads, glutes, hamstrings, calves, abs).

                        By increasing the volume of work done on each body part, you can hit a particular area from more than one angle while increasing the intensity of your training. In our sample workout, you'd do 6 sets—3 sets of 2 exercises—for each muscle group.
                    
                        You can train in two different rep ranges; the first is geared more toward strength (choose a weight in which you fail at 6-8 reps), and the second is on the upper end of the hypertrophy scale (a weight you can lift for 10-12 reps).
                    
                        Because you're doing a bit more volume for each body part, you'll need more rest days before repeating the same workout again.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Day 1: Upper-body muscle groups—2 exercises each, 3 sets, 6-8 and 10-12 reps</li>
                        <li>Day 2: Lower-body muscle groups—2 exercises each, 3 sets, 6-8 and 10-12 reps</li>

                    <h3 class="accordion-header">Push/Pull/Legs Split</h3>
                    <div class="accordion-content">
                        <p> Further progression as you gain experience allows you to do more volume for each muscle group, enabling you to train the entire body over the course of three days, not two. Although one can pair muscle groups in many ways, one of the most popular (shown below) is to do all the pushing muscles together (chest, shoulders, and triceps), all of the pulling muscles together (back and biceps), and then leg exercises. Abs can actually be done on any of these days.

                            The primary reason to link pushing muscles is that, with multijoint exercises, several body parts are already being called into play. For example, when bench pressing, the pecs, delts, and triceps work in concert. So, when training pecs, you might as well finish off the shoulders and triceps. The alternative—doing chest on Mondays, shoulders on Tuesdays, and possibly triceps on Wednesdays—doesn't allow enough recovery, since some of the muscles would be called into play on consecutive days.
                            
                            Adding a third exercise per muscle group is the easiest way to add more volume, ensuring you can again work the muscle from a different angle for more complete development. Here, too, you can use multiple rep targets, most often doing lower reps and compound movements early in the workout for each body part when you're fresh.
                            
                            You can do this workout twice over the course of the week (six workouts a week, as shown), or do it once (the first workout on Monday, the second on Wednesday, and the third on Friday). When doing it twice, you can also add a rest day every fourth day (three days on, one day off), so that you're technically doing the three-day split twice over the course of eight days, not seven. Of course, that depends on your schedule and need for rest.
